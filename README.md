### Bank_Manager
---


#### Hello friends
This is a practice and somewhat fun project to improve my skills and gain a deeper understanding of ```unit testing```
Also, I used prompt-sync  library to get user inputs and you can run App.js With node to use bank command line
```javascript
node ./app.js
```
Two parts make up the app ,
You can login as a customer or employer, and each feature section has its own methods. Use ```ID 1``` and ```password 1``` for the customer or ```ID 3 ```and ```password 3``` for the employee.
I focused more on test writing, that's why the ```app.js``` file is very dirty :)
